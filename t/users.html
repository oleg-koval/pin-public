$def with (user)
<h1>All Users</h1>
<p>Users that don't have a profile picture haven't uploaded one. I'll add in a default one as soon as I find one we can use without copyright issues.</p>
$for user in user:
    <hr/>
    <a href='/$user.username'>
        $if user.pic:
            <img src='/static/pics/$(user.pic).png' style='width: 50px; height: 50px'/>
            <br/>
        <b>$user.name</b>
    </a>
